## How to change your character in-game.

Ah yes, this question is asked somewhat often, how to change your character in-game.

**First**
In order to change your character, go into the storymenu/freeplay whatever you want.
Once your in the song you want, push 7 on your keyboard which should open the ChartingState.hx or just the ChartingState lol.

**Second**
There should be sections for character selecting, go to the one you want and there should be 2 dropdown menus.
The first dropdown menu means PLAYER 1(Which is you.) and the second dropdown menu means PLAYER 2(Which is who you are going against.).

**Last**
You can change either one of these if you want, then push ENTER on your keyboard, once your in the game/song, the character should be changed and ready to play/go against!
